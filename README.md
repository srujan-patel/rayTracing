## About
The goal of this project is to get familiar with C++ and learn the basics of computer graphics. In this project we go from rendering a simple image to rendering multiple objects (spheres) with reflections, shadows, and other properties.

## Getting Started


### Walnut App Template
This is a simple app template for [Walnut](https://github.com/TheCherno/Walnut) - unlike the example within the Walnut repository, this keeps Walnut as an external submodule and is much more sensible for actually building applications. See the [Walnut](https://github.com/TheCherno/Walnut) repository for more details.

Once you've cloned, you can customize the `premake5.lua` and `WalnutApp/premake5.lua` files to your liking (eg. change the name from "WalnutApp" to something else).  Once you're happy, run `scripts/Setup.bat` to generate Visual Studio 2022 solution/project files. Your app is located in the `WalnutApp/` directory, which some basic example code to get you going in `WalnutApp/src/WalnutApp.cpp`.

### Requirements
[Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com)
TO build and run the code use git --recursive clone
